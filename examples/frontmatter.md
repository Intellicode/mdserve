# Frontmatter Example

This is an example markdown file with YAML frontmatter at the top.

## What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is metadata placed at the beginning of a markdown file, between two sets of triple dashes `---`. It typically uses YAML syntax and can include various metadata like title, date, description, tags, etc.

## How It Works

When this file is rendered:

1. The frontmatter is extracted from the top of the document
2. The title replaces the default "Markdown Viewer" title in the HTML
3. The actual markdown content is rendered as HTML
